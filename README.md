# Waste Classification with CNN and ResNet50

This project implements a modular deep-learning pipeline for classifying waste images into six categories:

- cardboard
- glass
- metal
- paper
- plastic
- trash

The project supports both a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and a transfer-learning model based on ResNet50.

## Project objectives

The main objectives are to:

- download and organize the Garbage Classification dataset;
- split the images into training, validation, and test sets;
- preprocess the images with TensorFlow;
- train and compare CNN and ResNet50 models;
- evaluate the models using accuracy, loss, a classification report, and a confusion matrix;
- save every experiment and automatically track the best model in each model family;
- predict the class of individual test images.

## Modular architecture

The project is divided into independent modules so that each stage of the machine-learning workflow can be maintained, tested, and reused separately.

- `config.py`: stores global paths, image dimensions, batch size, random seed, class names, and split percentages.
- `download_dataset.py`: downloads the dataset from Kaggle and copies it into `data/raw/`.
- `split_dataset.py`: creates the training, validation, and test folders according to the configured percentages.
- `data_preprocessing.py`: loads the images as TensorFlow datasets and applies prefetching and optional caching.
- `model_builder.py`: builds either a configurable CNN or a ResNet50 transfer-learning model.
- `train.py`: trains the model and saves the configurations, checkpoints, logs, history, curves, and final model.
- `evaluate.py`: evaluates a trained model on the test set and generates predictions, metrics, a classification report, and a confusion matrix.
- `predict_test.py`: predicts the class of a selected image.
- `experiment_manager.py`: creates experiment folders and tracks the best CNN and ResNet50 models.

## Installation

Create and activate a virtual environment before installing the dependencies.

### Windows

```bash
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### macOS or Linux

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the project

Open the main notebook:

```text
notebooks/main_pipeline_project.ipynb
```

Run the cells in order to:

1. download the dataset;
2. split the dataset;
3. load the TensorFlow datasets;
4. select and configure a model;
5. train the model;
6. evaluate the experiment;
7. predict the class of a test image;
8. compare the current experiment with the best previous model.

## Model options

### Custom CNN

The CNN architecture is configurable through parameters such as:

- convolution filters;
- kernel size;
- activation function;
- batch normalization;
- dense layer size;
- dropout rate;
- learning rate;
- data augmentation.

### ResNet50

The ResNet50 model uses ImageNet pretrained weights and a custom classification head. The feature-extraction base can remain frozen or be fine-tuned in later experiments.

## Experiment tracking

Each training run is saved in a unique folder:

```text
experiments/cnn_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS/
experiments/resnet_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS/
```

An experiment can contain:

- `model_config.json`
- `training_config.json`
- `experiment_metadata.json`
- `model_summary.txt`
- `best_model.keras`
- `model.keras`
- `history.json`
- `training_log.csv`
- `accuracy.png`
- `loss.png`
- `evaluation.json`
- `predictions.csv`
- `confusion_matrix.png`

The best model from each model family is copied to:

```text
best_models/cnn/
best_models/resnet/
```

## Dataset

The dataset is downloaded through `kagglehub` from the Kaggle Garbage Classification dataset.

The image files are intentionally excluded from Git because datasets can be large and should be downloaded locally using the project pipeline.

## Reproducibility

The project uses a fixed random seed for data splitting and dataset shuffling. Exact results can still vary slightly depending on the TensorFlow version, hardware, operating system, and GPU configuration.
